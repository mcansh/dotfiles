From that version onward, the version of `react-for-atom` matches the React version.\n\nChanges to `react-for-atom` are reflected in pre-release versions (e.g. `0.14.6-1`). From a semver perspective, this doesn't make sense. However, because you should pin the version of `react-for-atom` anyway, this is a clear workaround for conveying React versioning info.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jgebhardt/react-for-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jgebhardt/react-for-atom#readme","_id":"react-for-atom@15.3.1-0","_shasum":"ca9a09ba697d8cae4cbe66ea76380cdf49d00d05","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/react-for-atom/-/react-for-atom-15.3.1-0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/react-for-atom/-/react-for-atom-15.3.1-0.tgz"}
